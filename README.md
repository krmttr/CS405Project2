# CS405 Project 2
This repository is for project 2 of CS 405, where I worked on implementing texture mapping, basic lighting, and rendering 3D models.

**GitHub Link:** https://github.com/krmttr/CS405Project2.git

## Tasks
### Task 1: Texture Mapping
In this task, I added textures to 3D models. I:
- Applied the textures to the models using UV coordinates.

### Task 2: Basic Lighting
I added basic lighting to the scene, including:
- **Ambient light** for overall brightness.
- **Directional light** to simulate sunlight.

### Task 3: Rendering and Transformations
In this task, I:
- Rendered 3D models with the applied textures.
- Applied simple transformations.
